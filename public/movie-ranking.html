<h1>The Best Movies For a Bad Day According to Jessica</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 comfort movies</h2>

 <hr />

<h3>Tangled</h3>
    <p>This movie is fun and lighthearded with great songs to sing along to. It brings me joy whenever I watch it.</p>
<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
    <p>Who can be sad when they are listening to Hugh Jackman sing. An added bonus is the lighthearted theme of finding your place in a world that doesn't want to accept you.</p>
<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
    <p>I don't care if it is a kid's movie, dragons are freaking cool. Also who doesn't love Toothless and his adorable nature.</p>
